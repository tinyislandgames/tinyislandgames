# Hi there!

We are a small indie studio based in Hobart, Tasmania. Our aim is to make good games in an ethical and sustainable way - which at this stage of our journey means we work dayjobs and mostly work on our games for at most a couple of hours per week.

We have release our first title, Plains of Havoc into early access on Steam.

Oh, and we also build and host the occasional website.
