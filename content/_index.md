# Tiny Island Games

Tiny Island Games is a small development studio based in Hobart, Australia. It was founded by [Michael](https://michaelhinz.dev) to bridge the gap between hobbyist and professional game development.

It is our goal to create a sustainable studio that’s [focused on growing the local Tasmanian games industry](./about_us/). We’re currently developing our first original title, Plains of Havoc, which is due to release in late 2024.
