When we're not making games we make websites instead!

Here you'll find a rough guideline of our process, how we can help and if we're the right fit for your needs. We'll do our initial consultation for free, work out all the details based on your needs and then give you a quote for building and hosting the proposed website.

While every website is different, we usually end up quoting between $2,000 and $10,000 per project.

## Consultation

---

We work primarily with WordPress websites as they are usually the most suited for the client. Once configured correctly, they can rank extremely well in Google searches and are easily updated and adjusted by the client directly.

That doesn't mean that WordPress is a silver bullet - we'll work with you to determine if a static page (like this one!), other type of Content Management System (CMS) or a fully custom coded website is more suitable for you and your business.

As part of our initial consultation we'll work out the following aspects:

* Website type
* Website purpose
* Single or multi-page
* Privacy Policy
* Social Media integration
* Analytics
* Google Business Profile
* Business Email Address
* Domain Name
* DNS configuration

## Hosting & Maintenance

---

There are many ways to host a website on the internet, and many more ways to do it insecurely. We believe that each of these are so important that they are non-negotiables for hosting with us, and are included in all our packages by default.

* Daily Backups
* Updates
* SSL/TLS
* Global CDN

## Analytics

---

Usually the main reason for a business website is to increase awareness, drive sales or showcase your portfolio and services. In order to measure the success we can tie into Google Analytics to track how many visitors you get to your website, which pages they look at, how long for and much, much more.

This is not strictly required but immensely helpful to work out which social media channels (and posts) are the most successful in accomplishing your goal. We'll integrate analytics with your website to provide you with an easy to understand dashboard to visualize your traffic.

## Google Business Profiles

---

Your online presence can go much further than a website - it's worthwhile configuring a Google Business Profile for your business to ensure potential customers and clients have quick access to all the information about your business that they need.

You've likely seen this before if you've Googled any business - it's that little card to the right of your search results detailing the website, opening hours, contact number, directions, reviews and more.

This isn't strictly required, and sometimes won't make sense for a particular type of business, we'll work this out as part of our consultation.

## Domain Name & Business Email Setup

---

If you're just starting out you may not yet have registered a domain name (e.g. [tinyislandgames.com](https://tinyislandgames.com)). Deciding on one is dependant on a couple of factors and important to get right. While it is possible to change this after the fact, it is a little bit of work and can effectively reset your google search ranking.

We can help you pick out and purchase the domain name, however we encourage you to register it in your own name. It's a little bit like a property title deed, whoever has the rights to it can do what they want with it. Most registrars (fancy name for Domain Landlords) have functionality to delegate access of your domain name an external party (such as ourselves), while you retain ultimate ownership over it.
