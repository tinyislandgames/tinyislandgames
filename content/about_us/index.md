Located in Lutruwita/Tasmania.

We're a small studio focused on sustainable game development. We're trialling a "one-day-per-week" gamedev approach due to the risky nature of making games full-time. We each dedicate around one day per week making games and keeping our dayjobs for financial security. While this does slow down development, it enables us to make games that may flop without affecting our financial stability.

We founded the studio with the growth of the local games industry in mind, working closely with the [Tasmanian Game Makers](https://tasgamemakers.com/) and [UtasPlay](https://www.utas.edu.au/built-digital-natural/ict/research/games-and-creative-technologies/utasplay) to organize local gamejams and meetups, as well as generally share our experience of starting and running an indie studio.
