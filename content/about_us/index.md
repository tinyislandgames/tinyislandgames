Located in Hobart, Tasmania, Tiny Island Games is an indie games studio currently focused on making our first game, [Plains of Havoc](../plains_of_havoc/). We founded the studio with the growth of the local games industry in mind, working closely with the [Tasmanian Game Makers](https://tasgamemakers.com/) and [UtasPlay](https://www.utas.edu.au/built-digital-natural/ict/research/games-and-creative-technologies/utasplay) to organize local gamejams and meetups, as well as generally share our experience of starting an indie studio.

Additionally we offer third year projects at the University of Tasmania to enable students to build up a major portfolio piece by the time they graduate, and if appropriate, offering to develop that project post-graduation into a fully released title.
