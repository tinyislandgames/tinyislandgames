## Bugfixes
- Sword multi-hits were preventing sword from attacking as fast as it should be
- We are aware of some players experiencing crashes when using a controller, this is a confirmed Unity issue and will be fixed with their next update this week

## Performance Improvements
- Improved experience orb performance
- Improved chain-lightning performance

## Additions
- Added Svartalfheim ~~Slake~~ Draugr model
- Added Combat Roll skill node

## Changes
- Counter from 15% attack damage while invulnerable (1 rank) to 10% attack damage while invulnerable (2 ranks)
- Starting rerolls reduced from 2 to 1
- Adjusted the skilltree, you can now unlock up to 18 points to spend! However as a result of the new maximum scale some players will notice a loss of available points that will need to be unlocked again.
