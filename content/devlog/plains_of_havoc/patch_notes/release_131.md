## Changes
#### Berserker
- Berserker now works off of missing health, instead of granting a stack every time the player takes damage.

#### Clotting
- Clotting's timer is no longer reduced by killing enemies, but instead by the amount of empty hearts. Each empty heart increases the timer to tick down 100% faster.
- The timer only ticks down if you're missing at least one heart.
- Base time increased from 5 minutes to 7 minutes.

## Fixes
- Fixed Fearsome not resetting on next runs
- Fixed Movement speed bugs with Panic, Dashig and Ingenious
- Fixed Berserker sometimes reducing attack speed
- Fixed sfx not playing until the second time
- Fixed Screenshake setting not saving
- Fixed being able to exit out of the game-over screen and keep playing (lol)
