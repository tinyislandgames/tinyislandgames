## Bugfixes
- Time survived now also accounts for full hours (I didn't expect people to survive for longer than an hour)
- Spam-switching weapons no longer breaks attacking
- Adjusted experience requirements for the skill tree
- Overgrown no longer leaves you at 0.5hp, making it look like you're alive with 0 hp
- Multistrike 2 now shows the icon of what it unlocks next
- Fixed Fearsome 2 unlock icon
- Game can no longer unpause when getting damaged right as you level up, causing an unpaused level-up screen

## Additions
- Health regeneration animation for clotting
- Added a sound effect for when enemies receive upgrades
