      <description>Changes Berserker Berserker now works off of missing health, instead of granting a stack every time the player takes damage. Clotting Clotting&amp;rsquo;s timer is no longer reduced by killing enemies, but instead by the amount of empty hearts. Each empty heart increases the timer to tick down 100% faster. The timer only ticks down if you&amp;rsquo;re missing at least one heart. Base time increased from 5 minutes to 7 minutes. Fixes Fixed Fearsome not resetting on next runs Fixed Movement speed bugs with Panic, Dashig and Ingenious Fixed Berserker sometimes reducing attack speed Fixed sfx not playing until the second time Fixed Screenshake setting not saving Fixed being able to exit out of the game-over screen and keep playing (lol) Leaderboard The leaderboard has been reset due to significant gameplay/balancing changes.</description>

      <description>Located in Hobart, Tasmania, Tiny Island Games is an indie games studio currently focused on making our first game, Plains of Havoc. We founded the studio with the growth of the local games industry in mind, working closely with the Tasmanian Game Makers and UtasPlay to organize local gamejams and meetups, as well as generally share our experience of starting an indie studio.
Additionally we offer third year projects at the University of Tasmania to enable students to build up a major portfolio piece by the time they graduate, and if appropriate, offering to develop that project post-graduation into a fully released title.</description>

      <description>Decimate endless hordes of enemies across the nine realms of Yggdrasil for eternal glory! Plains of Havoc is a fierce 2D top-down roguelite set in the Viking afterlife in which you fight for your rightful place on the global leaderboards.
Fight, die, feast and repeat! Whenever you fall in glorious battle, your levels are sacrificed to unlock powerful permanent upgrades, turning you into a force to be reckoned with. Slain enemies may also leave behind Tribute, which can be used to unlock new weapons and cosmetics to flaunt your wealth in the Great Hall.</description>
